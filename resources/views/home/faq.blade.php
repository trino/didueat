                The best way to deal with a problem with your order, whether it contains the wrong items, or if there is some other problem, is to contact the restaurant itself. The restaurant is best prepared to deal with your concerns, as they are the ones who have prepared it, packaged it, and delivered it. The contact number for the restaurant can be found in your order confirmation email.

                If your food has not been prepared, most restaurants will be happy to comply with order changes. To make a change, please contact our help line (1-888-888-8888) as soon as possible after placing your  order, and we will see if the restaurant is able to adjust your order (a small, $1 charge will apply for any changes made after you have placed an order). Please do remember that there may be a refund or         additional charge, depending on the changes you make. If a refund is to be made to you, this will apply to the same account for which you paid, and will require a few to be processed by the credit card           company or bank. If your changes require an additional cost, an email will be sent to your registered email address confirming the changes to your order, and will include a link to a payment page. Please         follow this link as soon as possible, because your order will be placed on hold until your new payment is made. Once payment is received, the restaurant will receive your updated details, and an additional       order confirmation email will be sent to you.

                Yes, because a transaction will be performed if you place an order. This can be done at any time before you place an order. In fact, you can do this at your checkout if that is more convenient for you. Registration is necessary because {{ DIDUEAT }} is simply the ordering service, with your orders being fulfilled by independent restaurants from which you have chosen to order your food. Thankfully, there is a very simple registration process, asking for just your name, phone number, email address and a password. Of course, if you want to place an order for delivery, you will need to provide a delivery address -- which can be added at checkout time, or can be stored with your account for easy access in the future. Rest assured, that {{ DIDUEAT }} will keep your information secure, and that it will be kept strictly confidential.
                <div style="font-size:5px;line-height:5px"><br/><br/></div>
                Please note, that you do not need to register if you are simply browsing the site. However, we're sure that when you see the many delicious meals that can be ordered from your cellphone or computer, you'll want to start placing orders as soon as possible.

                Certainly. Many of us spend time at different locations, whether you are visiting your girlfriend or boyfriend, your parents or children, or while you are at work. You can also add delivery addresses at checkout time, in case you are at a friend's place and find yourself really wanting something to eat. Just pick up your cellphone, or borrow a computer, and login to your {{ DIDUEAT }} account. With {{ DIDUEAT }}, you can enjoy your meals delivered almost anywhere our restaurants are found.

                No problem. Since you need to have an email address in order to register, you simply have to click the Forgot Password? link on the login pop-up, and enter your email address you used to register at {{ DIDUEAT }}. We will then reset your password and send you a new one in your email. Since emails are unique identifiers requiring a login, you can be confident that your password is secure.
                <div style="font-size:5px;line-height:5px"><br/><br/></div>
                Please also note, that you can always change your password at any time by clicking your name at the top right of the page to display the My Profile pop-up. Here you can change your password to whatever you want -- to one that is more difficult, or one that is easier -- but don't make it too simple, otherwise you will be compromising your login.

                    This is a personal choice, which follows a number of guidelines. You can choose a percentage, usually between 15% and 20%, or you can choose a flat-rate tip, which is typically $4 to $5. For especially nice drivers, or for large and/or complicated orders, you may wish to increase these amounts accordingly.

                    {{ DIDUEAT }} uses the Haversine method, which is the same as saying, "As the crow flies." This does not indicate actual road distance, but does provide a good measure for how close you are to a restaurant. If you are unfamiliar with the directions to the restaurant, {{ DIDUEAT }} provides a handy Google Maps pop-up, which will proved greater information, including the option to discover distance by road.

                    Food allergies are a serious concern for people allergic to common food products. These include eggs, fish, milk, tree nuts, peanuts and ground nuts, MSG, shellfish, soya and wheat. Restaurants on {{ DIDUEAT }} are encouraged to release food allergy information with their descriptions, but unless a restaurant expressly states that they are safe with regards to particular food allergens, it is best to always assume that your food may have come in contact with something to which you are allergic. When in doubt, it is always best to seek firm assurances from the restaurants themselves.

                    Yes, the process is essentially the same, with a few considerations. Please bear in mind that not all restaurants will offer both delivery and pickup options -- if you see both options when placing your order, then you can specify your preference. Please also bear in mind that most restaurants will place an additional charge on your order to pay for delivery, and it is also customary to tip the driver accordingly. Lastly, the estimated time for delivery or pickup will be different, simply because it will take a little extra time to have your order delivered.
